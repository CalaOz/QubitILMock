Participants explore why classical rules break down at the quantum level and how concepts such as superposition, entanglement, wave–particle duality, and measurement reshape our understanding of nature. Through thought experiments, historical debates, and modern experiments, the session explains not only what makes quantum mechanics strange, but why these ideas emerged and how they were experimentally validated — all without equations or technical prerequisites."
